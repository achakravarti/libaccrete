/** [base:ext:hot]
 * NAME
 *      C_HOT - hints a function as hot
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      #include "libchrysalis/api.h"
 *
 *      #define C_HOT
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The `C_HOT` macro is used to hint that a function is hot, i.e. it is
 *      called often. When C_HOT is applied to a function, the compiler _may_
 *      optimise it more aggressively, reordering the function so that it
 *      appears in a special section with other hot functions so as to improve
 *      locality.
 *
 *      This macro uses the non-standard `__attribute__((hot))` decorator, and
 *      is available for both GCC and Clang. On other compilers, the default
 *      behaviour of this macro is to degrade safely to a no-op with a suitable
 *      warning message. If you don't want this warning message to be displayed,
 *      then define the macro `C_SUPPRESS_EXTENSION_WARNINGS` at compile time.
 *
 * FILES
 *      `C_HOT` is defined in /usr/local/libchrysalis/include/ext.h.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *      C_HOT int foo(char *, int *);   // standard declaration
 *      void bar(float *) C_HOT;        // alternate declaration
 *     
 *      // can also be applied on definitions
 *      C_HOT static int foobar(char *foo, char c)
 *      {
 *              *foo = c;
 *              return (int) c;
 *      }
 *
 * NOTES
 *      - `C_HOT` is ignored by GCC if the `-fprofile-use` flag is used during
 *        compilation.
 *      - Although Clang recognises the `__attribute__((hot)) decorator, it
 *        drops it silently; however, there is a proposal to implement this.

/** [base:ext:cold]
 * NAME
 *      C_COLD - hints a function as cold
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      #include "libchrysalis/api.h"
 *
 *      #define C_COLD
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The `C_COLD` macro is used to hint that a function is cold, i.e. it is
 *      unlikely to called. Functions that are marked with `C_COLD` are
 *      optimised by the compiler for size rather than speed, and are placed
 *      into a special cold section in order to improve locality of code with
 *      other cold functions. Exception handlers are good candidates for marking
 *      with `C_COLD`.
 *
 *      This macro uses the non-standard `__attribute__((cold))` decorator, and
 *      is available for both GCC and Clang. On other compilers, the default
 *      behaviour of this macro is to degrade safely to a no-op with a suitable
 *      warning message. If you don't want this warning message to be displayed,
 *      then define the macro `C_SUPPRESS_EXTENSION_WARNINGS` at compile time.
 *
 * FILES

 * EXAMPLE
 *      C_COLD int foo(char *, int *);  // standard declaration

 *
 * NOTES
 *      - `C_COLD` is ignored by GCC if the `-fprofile-use` flag is used during

 *      - Unlike the case of `C_HOT`, Clang does _not_ silently drop this macro.

/** [base:ext:likely]
 * NAME
 *      C_LIKELY() - hints predicate as likely to be true
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      #include "libchrysalis/api.h"
 *
 *      #define C_LIKELY(_P_)
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The `C_LIKELY()` macro provides a branch prediction hint to the
 *      compiler, indicating that a predicate expression `_P_` is likely to be
 *      true. `_P_` is expected to be an integral predicate expression that
 *      evaluates to a Boolean value.
 *
 *      This macro uses the non-standard `__builtin_expect()` macro, and is
 *      available for both GCC and Clang. On other compilers, the default
 *      behaviour of this macro is to degrade safely to a no-op with a suitable
 *      warning message. If you don't want this warning message to be displayed,
 *      then define the macro `C_SUPPRESS_EXTENSION_WARNINGS` at compile time.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE
 *      The Boolean value which the predicate `_P_` evaluates to is returned.
 *
 * FILES
 *      `C_LIKELY` is defined in /usr/local/libchrysalis/include/ext.h.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *      int foobar(char *foo, char c)
 *      {
 *              if (C_LIKELY (foo != NULL)) {
 *                      *foo = c;
 *                      return (int) c;
 *              }
 *
 *              return -1;
 *      }
 *
 * NOTES
 *      - This macro is inspired by the `likely()` macro in the Linux kernel.
 *      - Marking a predicate as likely with `C_LIKELY()` when it is not so will
 *        have the contrary effect of degrading performance.
