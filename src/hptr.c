 *
 * __DESCRIPTION__
 *      The *HEAD_INDEX* symbolic constant represents the index at which the

 *      This symbolic constant is used by the implementation of the heap pointer

 *
 * __NOTES__
 *      The head segment of a heap pointer instance is located in the first

 *
 * __SYNOPSIS__
 *      __CODE__(static size_t align_fix(size_t aln);)
 *
 * __DESCRIPTION__
 *      The *align_fix()* support function fixes a bad alignment value *aln* by
 *      rounding it up to the nearest valid value. This function is used only
 *      internally by the heap pointer implementation and is **not** part of the
 *      interface.
 *
 * __RETURN__
 *      This function returns an alignment that is rounded up to the nearest
 *      valid alignment of *aln*.
 *
 * __NOTES__
 *      The *align_fix()* function returns an alignment that is rounded up to
 *      the nearest power of two that is also a multiple of the native size of a
 *      *void ** pointer; this is as per the requirements of *posix_memalign()*.
 *
 *      The *align_fix()* function is meant to be used only with invalid values
 *      of *aln*; hence no check is made to determine whether or not *aln* is
 *      valid in the first case.
 *
 *      The case of negative values of *aln* are especially problematic since
 *      fixing them with the current algorithm leads to an invalid alignment of
 *      0; hence, and additional check is made to ensure that this function
 *      returns at least the size of a *void ** pointer (which is guaranteed to
 *      be a power of 2 through a compile-time assertion).
