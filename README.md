## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è  DIY

Make sure you have the following available:
  - A POSIX-compliant OS
  - A POSIX-compliant shell
  - Git
  - make

Fire up your terminal emulator, and type the following commands in the shell:

```
$ git@github.com:achakravarti/libchrysalid.git
$ cd libchrysalid
$ ./configure	# required, generates Makefile
$ make		# required, builds libchrysalid
$ make check	# optional, runs unit tests
$ make man 	# optional, builds man page documentation
$ make example 	# optional, builds example programs
$ make install	# required, installs libchrysalid and optional components
```

The `libchrysalid` components are installed according to the standard POSIX file
system hierarchy. You can find the installed components at the following
locations:
  - */usr/local/bin/*
  - */usr/local/include/libchrysalid/*
  - */usr/local/lib/*
  - */usr/local/src/libchrysalid/*
  - */usr/local/share/doc/libchrysalid/*
  - */usr/local/share/examples/libchrysalid/*
  - */usr/local/share/man/*

If you want to remove `libchrysalid` and its optional components, simply run
either of the following:
  - `make uninstall` from the `libchrysalid` project directory, or
  - `/usr/local/bin/uninstall-libchrysalid`
